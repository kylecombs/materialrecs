The fleeting “Toridasu” layers immersive field recordings of unknown origin (could it be forest, brook, city or harbour?) under pastoral guitar explorations, ushering in both an informal and devotional, enchanting and everyday tone.Entries “Dango” and “Ashi” are both reworkings of previously released tracks, the latter appearing in a different iteration on Hanazono. “Dango” may be the most expansive of the four selections, its unfolding form glittering and glowing with new life. “Kiteki,” the penultimate tune, re-emerges from her 2018 album Potopo, a solemn and pensive song of traditionally lyrical intrigue.Colloid is primed for listeners with a feel for molecular subtlety and biological beauty, and a taste for Satomimagae’s living dioramas of ambient folklore. "

It is not strictly a one-note cloud, but a dazzling, stormy event that introduces an opportunity for reverence with the effervescent possibilities of harmonics in the sounds brought together."

While Young was working as a DJ at KSAN, an underground rock station in San Francisco, bassist Glenn Howell phoned him often to comment on the music he was playing. \"He told me he was a musician and I invited him to come down to the station. We started to talk about music, then decided to get together and play.\" Vocalist Aisha Kahlil met them through a mutual friend at one of their concerts, and after she came by a rehearsal she was soon invited to join the group.Infinite Sound brought a wildly inventive style, through the three musicians' personal background and imaginative takes on jazz, classical, sounds of the world, and Young's interest in electronic and avant-garde material. They often performed at rallies in support of various causes: Black Liberation, Women's Movement, Anti-War Movement, Gay Liberation... connecting with the burgeoning shifts in society and spiritual awakenings."

This is the debut release of their collaboration, joined by percussionist \nDirk Wachtelaer. Brooders rejoice on these blazed out, nearly trance-like dirges. The tone is reminiscent of twilight shining down through pine needles on moss below, while perhaps the comet featured on the cover passes overhead, connecting sky and ground in one fell swoop. The repetitive motifs ebb and flow between heroism and failure, depending on where you are seated in the metaphorical bar while they perform. \"Klauwzeer\" stands as the last track as a form of a way out, with its bright pad, perhaps a sonic character for the tail of the comet..."

    "description": "The first new album in 40 years from the celebrated Bay area composer and academic Loren Rush.The title piece \"Dans le Sable\" (1967-68, 70) covers the first side of the record, of which Charles Shere in the Oakland Tribune (1972) writes: “A surreal opera scene. A narrator dwells on the significance of passing time. A soprano sings Barbarina's cabaletta from Figaro, which describes her distraught search in the sand for a lost pin. The chamber orchestra—mostly solo instruments—plays soft, half-forgotten tunes reminiscent of the Parisian music hall. If Marcel Duchamp wanted to put painting once more at the service of the mind, so did Rush seem to want to make a composition that speaks directly to that thing behind the mind—the point where it connects with the soul. And he succeeded. But only because the work is so brilliantly constructed, so careful in its structure and the timing of its phrases, so well balanced in the disposition of its parts that it quite overcomes the audience.”"

    "description": "Sensitivity and curiosity synergize in these idiosyncratic piano experiments from  Rachel Langlais on the French label un je ne sais quoi. Dothe is conceptually anchored around the sound of two upright pianos in the tradition of John Cage’s seminal prepared piano pieces.The composer takes the listener in an imaginative, soaring direction as she altars the piano’s sound by placing plastic, wood and other materials between the strings. The end result is impressively rich and varied, from minimal and harmonious to frenetic and pleasantly cacophonous.The album name Dothe stems from a term in an Ursula K. Le Guin science fiction novel, which means a “nervous hysterical strength that can be controlled.” Langlais utilizes contemporary digital processing techniques, cutting and slowing down organic patterns into further innovative territory. A captivating release that masterfully plays the edge between graceful and dissonant, fusing contemporary elements with avant-garde history."

The conceptual location for ﻿Booker Stardrum﻿'s third album could be something out of a ﻿Dario Argento﻿ film, without the actual horror. Sumptuous, maximalist percussion is the centerpiece and Booker's forté, with acoustic instruments sampled and in agreement with the guiding character of each piece. The pieces are organized with an attitude of chaos and a tight arrangement. Absolutely a stunner of an album, and especially recommendable to those of you who are fans of the late Jon Hassell's last few albums."

    "description": "Initially incepted in 1993, Separate Elements is the masterwork of Prof. Charlie Hooker, a Brighton-based multi-disciplinary artist whose work focuses on glass sphere recording technology and its relationship to natural elements like the wind or the sun. In the two expansively scoped pieces that make up Separate Elements, reissued with love from All Night Flight, Hooker employs a substantial yet shifting amount of sunlight to communicate these organic forces to create a score of overwhelming synthesis. While operating as a world (of echo) of its own, Hooker's approach shares a common cause with the organic works of The Taj Mahal Travellers, Arthur Russell, and Inoyama Land, each of whom relied on the natural world and the spaces contained within to tell their stories and construct their spaces.  Believers of the Chee Shimizu mindset, and there are many, will nod to this with presence and passion."

    "description": "Compiled from several cassette tape releases between 1983 and 1993, this is the first time Dead Goldfish Ensemble has been released on vinyl. Originally released on the musician Steve Hartwell's own label, Peeved Records, the sound has been remastered for this new presentation of some of the earliest examples of domestic sequencers. Inspired by Kraftwerk's \"Autobahn,\" Hartwell began producing music with a sequencer and the MSX computer (an early Microsoft software architecture). Some of the pieces, like \"All the Hands\" are polyphonic and playful in their minimalism. Much of this, like most Yazoo recordings, are arranged through layered monophonic tracks. Instead of chords, simple melodic lines dance, repeat, and twist. The music is the epitome of an excited home enthusiast, exploring the burgeoning possibilities that have come to define music production today. Released by the Japanese label conatala."

A reputable sound designer and mixer in addition to composition and production, he comes to our lovely local friend's label Incienso with a release that touches on elements of dub techno, breakbeat, and glisteningly haunting sound design. The quality in sounds and arrangements of his work were already noticeably detailed and strong, but for this the space in the mix is brought to a higher level, allowing his distinct voice the space to groove. These are the kind of tracks that can work well for a warm up set, or the other side of dawn. Big ups to ﻿Otto﻿, and hopefully we hear more from ﻿﻿the Big Ever moniker. "

    "description": "Thanks to Unseen Worlds, (a Brooklyn based label that spotlights as-of-yet unheralded avant grade music), we have this lovely collection of music by Silvia Tarozzi, entitled Mi specchio e rifletto, or I Mirror and Reflect.Musically the album is infused with avant impulses, free jazz improvisation, and is accompanied by heavenly Italian vocals. Conceptually, the songs' are deeply inspired by the passionate poems of Alda Merini, so much so that Tarozzi spent years setting Merini’s poetry to music, then mirroring it with her own afterwards, the end result being Mi specchio e rifletto. The themes of love, motherhood, and the mystery hidden in the everyday are at the core of these sensitively wrought, beautiful tracks that unfold with cinematic, mystic grace.Flute, cello, electric and acoustic guitar, as well as sax, violin and keyboards are all at work here to create a majestical tapestry. At times there’s even a prog-like conjuring of fantastical musical scenes, as Tarozzi ponders the hidden surrealism within the mundane details of waking life."

    "description": "Unseen Worlds has taken up the responsibility of ensuring the musical output of Carl Stone shall go uninterrupted. In this quotation, we hear him seeking to magnify and dissect music we listen to, yet many of us may not listen to the music he \"hijacks.\" Through his process, his exploration of the inner workings is also less giving us a glimpse into the inner workings, but is instead re-presenting the familiar music to formulate an entirely new experience.He says his purpose is to offer them in new meaning \"via irony and subversion,\" but for us, the listener, we are offered the opportunity to go far beyond an ironic or subversive experience upon listening. As specific as the techniques may be, the abstract sonic playground he builds is an open-ended system for aural investigation that plays on our senses in a most individual way. \"These tracks were all made in late 2019 and 2020, much of when I was in pandemic isolation about 5000 miles from my home base of Tokyo. All are made using my favorite programming language MAX. However distinct these two groupings might be they share some common and long-held musical concerns. I seek to explore the inner workings of the music we listen to using techniques of magnification, dissection, granulation, anagramization, and others. I like to hijack the surface values of commercial music and re-purpose them offer a newer, different meaning, via irony and subversion.\" - Carl Stone, Los Angeles, September 2020"

    "description": "RAMZi's uniquely gifted ear continues to aid in her creation of instantly recognizable beats. Through her already lengthy output, she has developed a sound all her own. Whether it is watery, filtered percussion sounds or her mysterious melodies, two beats and you know it's RAMZi. A native to Montréal, she continues to bring the heat and impress with her ninth studio album, cocon. Let \"coeur dodu\" dance with you to a high mountain grassland, or be one with your mRNA vaccine to the tune of \"mutation\". Wickedly detailed tunes with four dimensional movement, these are some of her most inviting tracks to date.&gt;"

    "price": "2500",
    "artist": "John Small",
    "quantity": 10,
    "description": "First discovered in an all-time fave dollar bin in a land not so far away, Old Enough to Know Better is a wildly inventive piece of pop obscurity by John Small. Released in 1984 by Harbor Sounds, a label that started and ended with the release of Small’s first and only album, Old Enough to Know Better isn’t the derivative, DIY synth drivel found on plenty of platters of its time, rather a high level production of some truly endearing pop songwriting. Old Enough manages to avoid the pitfall of so many privately pressed rock and New Wave records of the 80s in Small’s genuine admiration and expert application of the pop rock formula. A British transplant to Richmond, Virginia, Small was a charismatic guitar player and venue fixture, delivering the local music scene some real, and authentic, talent amidst the Second British Invasion.With that confidence, a great backing band, and a seemingly reasonable recording budget, Small came up with Old Enough to Know Better. The album isn’t a holy grail, and it isn’t without flaws. But if you remove the constructs of context and let this LP play, it’s just a really enjoyable listen. “I Know It’s Over” is the huge bop here (for those who asked, this is the ??? - ??? from this NTS mix), while both “Strength to Strength” and “Last Chance to Slow Dance” hold their own in other ways. Stock here is limited, priced for discovery, and with that glorious cover artwork inviting you to throw your cool clothes in the hamper and jump in the inviting waters. Quack!"

This 2xLP showcases years of developing extended techniques and improvisations, playing with other luminaries like Meredith Monk, Theo Bleckmann and Mary Halvorson. With an air of grace, the rich, thick, resonant tones produced by Patricia from the marimba and vibraphone are of a gorgeous sonority to help instill a sense of calm and wonder. In her own words, \"From bowing and bending pitch, to the use of extended effects via guitar pedals, this album reflects my vision for the vibraphone and the potential of all the possible ways it can be played. I wanted to not only incorporate all those techniques in the compositions but also wanted them to become part of my general improvisatory language.”This potential can be heard across the 12 pieces on this album. Most are solely either instrument, but there are moments with electronic effects incorporated. One of the first releases of 2021 we are carrying, out on Valley of Search. We're very happy to have a few in store to share with you."

    "description": "The first solo debut by Mexican born, New York-based vibrphonist, marimbist, and composer Patricia Brennan. This 2xLP showcases years of developing extended techniques and improvisations, playing with other luminaries like Meredith Monk, Theo Bleckmann and Mary Halvorson. With an air of grace, the rich, thick, resonant tones produced by Patricia from the marimba and vibraphone are of a gorgeous sonority to help instill a sense of calm and wonder. In her own words, \"From bowing and bending pitch, to the use of extended effects via guitar pedals, this album reflects my vision for the vibraphone and the potential of all the possible ways it can be played. I wanted to not only incorporate all those techniques in the compositions but also wanted them to become part of my general improvisatory language.”This potential can be heard across the 12 pieces on this album. Most are solely either instrument, but there are moments with electronic effects incorporated. One of the first releases of 2021 we are carrying, out on Valley of Search. We're very happy to have a few in store to share with you."

    "description": "By repurposing tanks that stored dead fish in the GDR era and utilizing techniques heard on her previous album Musique Hydromantique, Tomoko Sauvage reaches backwards and forwards in the same gesture. Having spent years honing her craft using hydrophones in porcelain and glass bowls, she is able to make full use of everything the large, brick, former water tanks in Prenzlauer Berg have to offer. \"Deluge\" is the handshake, the greeting. A rushing cacophony begins the piece in a grand scale, and trails away over the course of six minutes to micro-sounds.﻿ Fischgeist﻿, meaning 'fish spirit', brings the listener to the plane of intention set out by Sauvage. The bottomless sounds reverberate us into a lucid suspension and hold us there. A beguiling achievement that is the most interesting release from her yet.<a href=\"https://tomokosauvage.bandcamp.com/album/fischgeist\">Fischgeist by Tomoko Sauvage</a>"

    "description": "In this epoch, it's a challenge to name many artists as epochal as Joe Seaton. From the cryptic atmospherics of Ondo Fudd to the bright, transcendent 'club' of Call Super, Seaton's work is as consistently enjoyable as it is uncategorizable, always uncovering new layers of sound, context, and design; more aligned with Jazz music than club music. Seaton's latest under the latter, Every Mouth Teeth Missing, comes courtesy of our brilliant friends over at Incienso, adding another chapter in the mystifying story of Call Super.For Every Mouth Teeth Missing, Seaton has (like all of us) shifted out of the exterior of clubs and into the interior of the home, with the work on his latest appropriately reflecting this sheltered-in-place era. Piquant and uncanny sounds of the home, the apartment, the kitchen, evoke a domesticated feeling on this record. On \"Welcome New People\", the listener is lulled into a lighter and brighter environment as the beat slowly erodes. While on what could be the centerpiece of this work, \"Pay As You Glow\", featuring the now-trademark cameo from his father, David Seaton, channels the warm glow and optimism of 90's IDM, broken down into a future-jazz style that feels signature to Seaton's uncatergorable work. Call this Interior Dance Music. As always with Seaton's music, it never succumbs to the lifelessness of the technology that creates it, always pushing to make things as free, instinctual, and human as possible. <a href=\"https://callsuper.bandcamp.com/album/every-mouth-teeth-missing\">Every Mouth Teeth Missing by Call Super</a>"

    "description": "\"Galaxies spin - ignoring our prayers - fields of gravity - crushing space - waves and particles - glued into place - by the strong and the weak - by the cold and hot - radiating light - to a tiny dot\"For Chris Korda's new album, her second on Perlon, she has devoted it entirely to the harsh realities that face our planet. Some choose to ignore, others tackle head on, and Chris Korda brings the discussion into her distinctive realm of sounds. In some ways, these feel like the songs that Laurie Anderson didn't get around to writing. The hope of continuing on this planet means reining in production, moving beyond post-truth, and for people to \"grow up and face reality, or we simply won't be around.\"Sung entirely with a vocoder effect, the compositions are built from systems Korda has developed, inspired by inventory and light artist Thomas Wilfred, that generate rhythms and melodies through a shifting juxtaposition in the arrangements. This is an immensely ambitious project that is unlike anything else around."

    "description": "Once or twice a year we receive a visit from Glasgow's Domestic Exile, a label charting its own strange path through the world of homespun, left-of-everything electronic music, based primarily in the Scottish capitol. In a banner year for the unusual and unexpected, they have returned with an LP courtesy of Portuguese artist Luar Domatrix appropriately titled \"Nova Vida Passada\", or \"New Past Life\".Familiar to Commend faithful for \"Koppa D\", their contribution to 12th Isle's Inkosi compilation, an inspired slice of ethereal dembow rhythms, the pieces contained herein should neither disappoint nor uninvite. From the jump of its celestial opening track \"Ponte Pedestre\" and its accompanying album artwork -- a disembodied Blackberry floating through the cosmos -- Nova Vida Passada invites you into its journey to known unknowns. What follows is a collection of contemporary Portugeuse club music meshed with 90's R&B echolalia, expressed in a way that is both cryptic and open. Tunes like \"Sense of Style\" sample the lush strings of Soul 4 Real's \"Candy Rain\" and filter it through a deep-reggaeton similar to Commend favorite DJ Python. On the other end, tunes like \"I'll Fly With You\" are loaded with fragmented vocal samples that are at once familiar and unfamiliar, as if the future that we are imagining through this music is being heard now.Recommended if you like anything on Equiknoxx, NAAFI  "

Stephen Mallinder of Cabaret Voltaire's debut solo album is available again from Ice Machine, a sub label of the Canadian electro imprint Suction Records.Some words from Mr.Mallinder on the scene and era from which “Pow Wow” was born: “It was an interesting, and inspiring, time. The primal caterwaul of punk was dying and lots of really significant things were emerging from the fires. Much looser vibes were in the air and there was a much more exploratory feel. Punk had championed a visceral, anti-intellectual approach but in truth the real characters brought so much more to the table, and what began to happen - from people like The Pop Group to Throbbing Gristle, and emerging scenes from No New York to Factory Records - is we began to embrace the art of it all. There was acknowledgement of the importance of books, films, graphic art, and experimentation with all those mediums. We were just as interested in turning over rocks to see what lay beneath, as throwing them. There was a sense of new magik emerging.”  <a href=\"http://pow-wow.bandcamp.com/album/pow-wow\">Pow Wow by Stephen Mallinder</a>"

    "description": "Giraffe captured our imaginations with erstwhile offerings for Meakusma, Juni (2017) and Shine And Dark (2019). Sumptuous, enigmatic musical curiosities knitting together ambient and free improvisatory influences with psych / kraut flair, quietly theatrical dreamscapes humming and creaking with electroacoustic detail. Sascha Demand thrums guitar, Jürgen Hall plays keys, and Charly Schöppner deftly weaves percussion in ritualistic threads. The three transfer unique and prestigious (if eccentric) careers in music into this superlative project, citing the Viennese School (Schoenberg et al) and the Köln School (for its early electronic experiments) as primary inspirations. Their new album, Desert Haze, arrives via Ali Safi’s wonderful Marionette label, which aptly invokes the influence of “Saharan traditional music of the Tuareg” in addition to these foundations. Recorded and produced at Le Garage, in Hamburg, the first half of Desert Haze was created by combining free improvisation and a serialism \"rule set”, layering instruments and structures based “around tone color and pitch analysis of resonating prepared guitar sounds”. Its second half reflects a more intuitive playing style on a pared down set up - “representative of what you may hear when listening to them live”. "

    "description": "Kyle Martin and Jonny Nash’s Land of Light project returns seven years after their ESP Institute debut. The World Lies Breathing was devised over two years, and shares a meticulous vision of contemporary abstract composition. Clear and sparse but sometimes sinewy and granular, its eight parts were fabricated from a range of materials -  acoustic instruments resonating unrecognizably, contact microphones recording anonymous entities, and Martin’s self-built modular synthesizer doing most of the rest. Silence, which fills the spaces between sounds abundantly, might be the fourth element in the mix and perhaps the most powerful. The World gently lurches in and out of sonic range, creeping around the edges of consciousness and illuminating small but foundational concepts: minuscule moments of tenderness, the nature of matter, ancient mysteries shimmering beyond the horizon of language. An attenuated string sliding over rusted surface, piano notes plunking like water droplets, split-second apparitions of celestial chords, textured melodies and humming signals bleeped into nothingness.

Ben Babbitt, known for his indie film and game compositions, attends closely to this cue, crafting an eerily fogged soundtrack full of dread and suspense that oscillates between stark minimalism and oppressive layering. "

    "description": "Arcane archivists Concentric Circles, the Portland, Oregon-based workshop operated by Freedom to Spend’s Jed Bindeman, present another would-be vanished collection of self-released cassette recordings ripe for re-exploration. For The Moment introduces the composer John di Stefano’s distinctive synthesized, polyrhythmic kosmische music, conceived in transit from San Francisco to Japan, by way of Indonesia. Harnessing the experimental power of the Buchla and Serge modular systems available to him through University studios in 1980s SF, and drawing on a background in percussion, di Stefano expanded his practice through the study of Indian music and tabla, and became particularly influenced by Javanese gamelan music. New age lightwork transmissions carried with dexterous tabla detail (“Compos Mentis”) encounter post-punk musings (as in rhythm machine-driven instrumental “For the Moment” and sassy spoken-word guitar and live-drum slink “Knocking At My Door”). Unhinged ten minute modular, tabla and mallet jam “Nuage” meets its match in highlight “Ng’s Office,” which pairs the twinkling, chromatic gamelan ensemble melody with deft jazz drumming. For the Moment features tracks from early cassette releases on his own imprint Oktron Produktions amongst previously unreleased material from the early 90s. "

Oscillating between sweet and sombre plainsong (“Songs Hurt Me” and “The Courtesan”), concrete experiments (“Falling Rock,” “Everyone Loves Olga”), and audacious art rock (“You Are Welcome on My Island,” “The Passionate One”), The Los Angeles artist and member of Party Boys joined with Phillip Drucker (AKA Jackson Del Ray from Savage Republic / 17 Pygmies) to develop this almost Caroline K-esque creation."

    "description": "Séance Centre delivers this slice of undeniably New York dubbed-out disco.\"In 1982, a group of friends deep into post-punk, jazz and dub got together in Mad Professor's legendary Ariwa studio and lay down their youthful interpretation of a NYC disco cut. Their unique take included trombone, vibraphone, piano and an ital dose of tape delay. They called the song Trouble and released two versions (vocal and dub) on their friend Tony McDermott's !Drum! label with artwork inspired by Russian Constructivism. The group, comprised of Justin Langlands, Chrysta Jones, John Schofield, Tom Dixon, and Dave Killen, decided to call themselves A-Team, having no idea that Mr.T and Co. would make them almost totally un-google-able 30 years later. The result of their adolescent studio idealism sounds akin to other disco misfits like Arthur Russell, Maximum Joy, Talking Drums and wouldn't sound out of place on legendary NYC label 99 Records. Remastered with an extended Club Dub for maximum dance-floor action.\""

Released on Break World Records. \"Thank you for supporting the new self-titled lp/cd written, performed, & edited by me. None of the drums were sequenced & i played them by hand bc don't know better. Much of the percussion was made from live recordings, some sampled & beat in my room w tio RIP. Some day I'll be able to travel w my drums & guitar. Til then my trusty keyboard will take care of me.\" - Elysia Campton, Instagram, 3 days ago"
